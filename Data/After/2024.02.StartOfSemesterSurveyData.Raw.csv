The depth that the course goes into, exploring abstract concepts such as vector spaces, linear transformations, and eigenvalues, has truly expanded my mathematical horizons. One aspect I particularly enjoy is the practical applications of linear algebra in various fields, from computer science and physics to machine learning and data analysis. The ability to apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems has made the subject matter more engaging and relevant.

Additionally, the emphasis on matrix operations and their role in solving systems of linear equations has provided me with a powerful toolkit for problem-solving. Manipulating matrices to represent and solve complex problems has been both intellectually stimulating and rewarding. The course has also introduced me to the elegance of mathematical proofs, helping me appreciate the beauty and logic behind the theorems we encounter.","In high school calculus, we only worked with minimal variables which made graphs easy to visualize. However, the only worry I have with the class is the ability to visualize the multivariable functions, as well as extend the ideas of differentiation and integration to multiple dimensions.","I must admit, linear algebra has been quite a journey for me. The abstract concepts and the depth of the material made it challenging, but I embraced the struggle and managed to grasp most of it. Now, as we delve into multivariable calculus, I can't help but feel a bit anxious. However, I hope to learn the most out of your teachings and look forward to the class."
