416,"My only concern about this course is that I will have an issue learning one of the fundamental items early in the course, and as a result of that, will struggle later on when building upon that foundational knowledge. ",AC,NA,NC
422,"My only concern is if I'll be able to study/prepare to the same degree for exams that I did last semester, but other than that I feel confident.",AC,NA,NC
408,"My only concern is that so far the video lessons are not as clear as they were in the linear algebra course. This could just be me, though as they are still very comprehensive.",AC,NA,NC
356,"One thing that was concerning for me last semester was my mastery on certain topics. There were some topics in linear algebra that I couldn't fully explore due to other work and activities. For MV Calc, I hope to fix this issue by writing notes and practice problems down so that I could review it again in depth later.",AC,NA,NC

187,"The percentage for the exams concerns me the most, as the high number puts pressure on students. ",AC,NA,NC
440,The quick pace of the lecture videos and occasional lack of explanation on a problem. ,AC,NA,NC
488,There has been some time since I worked on much of the calculus coursework so it may be a little rusty at the start of this semester.,AC,NA,NC
424,"There's 2 MML courses (old version and new). I did MML1 on the new version, but the grade didn't change in canvas. When I do a question on the old version, the grade updates. ",AC,NA,NC
492,too much homework,AC,na,NC
581,What concerns me most about taking the course is that the material may be a little difficult to learn since the course is online. ,AC,NA,NC
583,What concerns me the most about taking this course is being able to balance the large workload of this class along with the large workload of my other classes in a way that enables me to complete and do well on all this class's assignments while also gaining a strong understanding of the information that we are learning.,AC,NA,NC
427,What concerns me the most about taking this course is not have sufficient time for completing all the material. It is a very small concern.,AC,NA,NC
475,"It simply concerns me that I cannot ask my professor questions in person, and is completely at the mercy of both my and the professor's schedule. ",AC,NA. ,NC
315,I found topics related to LaGrange difficult last year and I feel like it will be hard for me to pick up on the content surrounding it. I will look for extra help from TAs and instructors.,AC,No individual needs. Very excited to learn the topics in Multivariable Calculus. ,NC
481,"My main concern is this is so so so much more difficult than high school math. It's really quite a jump and catches you off guard at first.

",AC,No nothing much. Matrices are my worst nighPCare and I hope they go away permanently.,NC
481,"Also, neither the written assignment nor the exams are appearing on my course feed and that is kind of an issue. ",TC,No nothing much. Matrices are my worst nighPCare and I hope they go away permanently.,NC
563,I probably forgot a lot of calc BC.,AC,None,NC
463,I want to have more practice taking practice assessments and tests for prep. I want to just have some more additional practice before the actual exams come around.,AC,None,NC
341,"There might be several topics that rely on prerequisite knowledge that our school didn't address fully, and I am unsure if there is an appropriate calculator for 3D information. Additionally, Exam 3 and the final exam are during school holidays/events/exams, so I'm unsure if that will work out well. ",AC,none,NC
253,"Nothing that I've seen, but I have heard from several others who have taken the course in the past about the difficulty of this semester.",AC,"None, I am glad there are not quizzes anymore and just MMLs, as they were far more helpful to me in linear algebra :)",NC
261,I do not have any concerns.,NC,None.,NC

306,The amount of work.,AC,Nothing so far. Just only started. ,NC
439,The abstractions sometimes scare me,AC,"Nothing, I am very excited!",NC
159,"I'm afraid I won't be able to retain the information I learn well enough to be able to teach it to someone else. Teaching it to someone else helps me understand better, so I'm afraid that I won't be able to understand to that level.",AC,"The course seems a little more rigorous, but I think if I just reach out when I need help, I'll be alright.",AC
513,"The concerns that I have taking the course are the varied amount of work that each unit would take and the format of the module tests. For example, I am anxious that the test content may be from a unit that was covered briefly from many lessons ago that I may not have had time to review for.",AC,The course so far is navigable and allows me time to work on the assignment.,NC
225,"I think I’m most concerned about getting an A in the course and being able to balance the workload with all my other commiPCents. However, I felt the workload with linear algebra was optimal, and I am now finished with college applications, so I doubt that will be too much of a problem.",AC,There is nothing in particular I think you should know about me or my impressions of the course so far.,NC
213,"The only concern I have is the difficulty with the course knowing that many people have said that it will be very hard. However, I feel like it'll be alright considering my performance in linear algebra. ",AC,There is nothing individually that I would need. I very much like the course so far because of its similarity to the layout of the linear algebra course. ,NC
185,I do not have any concerns at the moment.,NC,There is nothing so far.,NC
430,"Last year, I struggled a lot with true and false questions and concerned that I might repeat the same thing this semester.",AC,,NC
11,The tests being in MML makes them difficult to complete on mobile.,TC,NA,NC
242,I wish that every single question on the homework had a walk you through it or an example.,AC,N/A,NC
368,"I would like to focus on retaining the material better, since I find it harder to retain the information as well for online courses.",AC,N/A,NC
362,I'm a bit worried about the content and the difficulty. ,AC,n/a,NC
338,"I'm a little concerned as to whether or not I will be able to understand many of the topics we learn about, but I'm also confident that I will put in my best.",AC,N/A,NC
372,I'm just a little intimidated by how much the exams and final are worth.,AC,N/A,NC
414,"I'm slightly concerned about preparing from exams, but I know that I can look at practice exams and MML practice to study and ensure that I understand the material.",AC,N/A,NC
264,"My biggest concern is keeping up with the deadlines especially because the GT breaks do not align with school breaks, so I will make sure to stay on schedule",AC,N/A,NC
431,"My concern is the extra exam we have compared to last semester. Last semester, there was two exams and the final, but with the extra exam, I am worried about how it will all work out.",AC,N/A,NC
237,My only concern is if it will add too much to my course load this semester.,PC,N/A,NC
532,"One concern I have about this course is that I forgot much of what I learned in calculus last year. However, I believe I will able to review the material that is necessary for this course and will regain the skills. ",AC,N/A,NC
524,One concern or dislike I have is the canvas quizzes are taken away. These helped support my learning and understanding of the content much more. ,AC,N/A,NC
467,"That it's been a while since I've done calculus. I personally feel it would have been better to have multivar first semester. Unless line alg is a prerequisite, then ignore this.",AC,N/A,NC
387,The one thing that concerns me the most is the fact that the in-person exams are worth 10% more than in Linear Algebra.,AC,N/A,NC
450,"The only thing that concerns me about this course is that my calculus foundation is not strong. I believe last semester, my strong algebra foundation helped me a lot in linear algebra but this semester I am concerned about how my weak calculus foundation will impact my learning pace. ",AC,n/a,NC
328,"The only thing that worries me is that since this is mostly an online class, I might not get as much practice as I should in-person nsetting. Math requires a lot of practice; hence it is important that i get in sufficient practice before any of the assessments.",AC,n/a,NC
586,"The tests are 60% of our grade, we don't have quizzes anymore, and grades aren't dropped.",AC,N/A,NC
177,The thing that concerns me the most is having a smaller diversity of practice problems. I don't want to use the exam prep sheets before I begin studying for the exam but I would also like practice problems besides what is on MML. The extra credit webwork will hopefully cover this but it doesn't become available until the 22nd.,AC,N/A,NC
319,The weight of the exams worries me for getting a good grade.,AC,N/A,NC
298,"The workload, this is a college class so I will definitely have a lot more work here than in any of my other classes.",AC,N/A,NC
103,The increased complexity of the actual technical math work compared to linear algebra. I struggled occasionally in BC calculus so multivariable is daunting in comparison.,AC,"N/A, so far, the course feels alright but I will only really know about my impressions on its technical difficulty as we get farther in.",NC
558,"I feel like the 3 exams concern me since last semester we had 2. Also the final being worth 30% of the grade is a lot in my opinion, since I have never had a test weigh more.",AC,NA,NC
385,"I got a B last semester and I heard this class can be harder, so I’m worried about that.",AC,NA,NC
279,I think it's just the leap from weekly homeworks to mass studying a few days before exams.,AC,NA,NC
227,"I think my time management skills are the most concerning. Preparing well before a test, and studying consistently, I should manage my time well.",PC,NA,NC
594,I worry about falling behind in content. ,AC,NA,NC
405,"I'm a bit worried about the in-person examinations as they will now take up 60% of our grade. Other than that, I am not too worried. ",AC,NA,NC
535,"I'm afraid about the difficulty of this course, but that was also the same for last semester's. Calculus, especially series, was a struggle and I understand that I will do better if I put in more effort, but I still feel like I'm going to stress over learning. ",AC,NA,NC
527,I'm concerned about the level of importance for the exams (being now 30%) and I'm also worried for the lack of quizzes (since those were helpful).,AC,NA,NC
433,"I'm concerned the course may move quickly and that I will have to review calculus, which I may have forgotten since last year.",AC,NA,NC
369,I'm concerned with my calculus knowledge. I took AB and BC last year and havent done much review since. ,AC,NA,NC
194,I'm most concerned that I will not understand the material being taught and that I won't be able to execute my knowledge during the exams. I hope to mitigate this by consistently doing practice exams to prepare myself for the actual exam. ,AC,NA,NC
445,I'm worried I might have forgotten some of the stuff that the course expects me to know.,AC,NA,NC
361,"In linear algebra, I got into a groove with my coursework.  I feel like it is going to be a lot different with this course.  It is a different kind of math, there are no quizzes, there are three exams, and the lecturer is different.  My biggest concern is that the lady on the lecture videos does not do as great of a job as Dr. Mayer did with linear algebra.",AC,NA,NC
238,"My biggest concern is actually understanding the course content. So far, it seems a decent bit complicated, and I know it's only going to get harder.",AC,NA,NC
578,"I concerned about getting a B like last semester. Although I feel more confident in this course's material for reasons previously stated, I need to make sure I stay on task and adequately review material.",AC,N/A,NC
547,"I don't have a lot of concerns about this course, mainly just worrying about how well I'll learn the material. ",AC,N/A,NC
101,I am slightly concerned for the lack of a practice exam.,AC,I am very excited to be back in a calculus class!,NC
598,I am concerned about the pace of the course and the difficulty of the concepts taught throughout the course. ,AC,N/A,NC
410,I am nervous I will think I will understand the topic but ultimately fail the exams.,AC,N/A,NC
478,"I am concerned about the ""calculus"" portion as it relates to derivatives and integrals - although I was proficient in it, the concept can become quite complex.",AC,N/A,NC
174,* I'm concerned that I might have some difficulty learning online/not being able to ask questions as easily as I would be able to in a in-person class.,AC,N/A,NC
68,"As this course is going to mix linear algebra and calculus, I'm worried about the content. However, I plan to attend more studio sessions to fully understand this content. ",AC,N/A,NC
399,"At this point in the semester, I am most concerned about studying for the exams, as I am worried that my current studying techniques will be ineffective given the amount of content involved in an exam, more specifically the final exam. ",AC,N/A,NC
483,"At this point in the semester, true and false questions concern me the most in this course, as I do not do as well with conceptual questions. Luckily, Dr. Mayer mentioned that MATH 2551 is less theoretical so I am hoping it will be less difficult this semester.",AC,N/A,NC
455,I am a bit concerned about the difficulty of the course and the things I will need to do to manage my time with my other classes.,AC,N/A,NC
129,"I am most concerned about being able to learn online, because I struggled last semester and had to do a lot of group studying to understand some parts.",AC,N/A,NC
400,I am concerned about the lack of guidance from an in-person teacher. I often rely on asking the teacher questions to improve my understanding of certain concepts.,AC,NA,NC
499,I am concerned about the lack of quizzes. The quizzes in the linear algebra course helped me test my knowledge and I am not sure why this course does not have any.,AC,NA,NC
352,"I am concerned because I've heard that this is the hardest of all 4 distance math classes, so I'm scared that I won't understand something and won't do too well given that all exams combined are 60% of our grade.",AC,NA,NC
539,"I am concerned by the fast-moving pace of the course, but I believe with appropriate practice I will be able to gain a strong information of the content.",AC,NA,NC
351,I am concerned that I will not understand a concept and it will affect me for the rest of the course.,AC,NA,NC
500,I am concerned that I will struggle on exams with the lack of quizzes that I can retry like we could last semester. It showed me where to work more and promoted mastery of all subjects.,AC,NA,NC
247,"I am most concerned about getting behind on my work and getting stressed out, however that did not happen last semester so hopefully it doesn't this semester either. ",PC,NA,NC
517,I am most concerned about not understanding the course and not doing well on exams.,AC,NA,NC
365,"I am most concerned with keeping up with the course. There is often much math to cover each week, so it is important that I manage my time well so that I am able to sufficiently understand and apply the material.",AC,NA,NC
375,I am worried about the exams being worth 60% of the grade this time and I want to make sure I spend an even longer time studying for the exams. I am concerned about making sure I fully learn all the content this semester because I feel like semester it was easy to get by without fully learning the content until the exams. ,AC,NA,NC
570,"I am worried about the in person exams the most. In linear algebra I struggled to prepare well enough to see results despite studying, so I am worried that I will have the same struggles in this class. ",AC,NA,NC
339,I am concerned about being able to recall things from Calculus quick enough to understand the new concepts in the course.,AC,NA,NC
259,I am concerned about how much practice I will have to do using resources outside of the work given by this course once the topics become more complex.,AC,NA,NC
590,"I am concerned about the exams because they have a much higher weight in this class, and the exams in linear algebra were hard for me. I am also concerned that I lost a lot of my knowledge of BC Calculus since it has been a while. ",AC,NA,NC
415,Although I said I enjoy the incorporation of physics it also could be a challenge for me. I'm not the greatest at physics but it is just going to have to be part of the process and I'll take more time to understand how to use it in this class. ,AC,NA,NC
158,"As the last time I had practiced calculus was 8+ months ago, I am a bit worried about my ability to remember the application of certain skills. ",AC,NA,NC
161,"At this point, I'm not worried about the difficulty of the work, I'm worried about the timing of it since my spring semester looks like it will be busier than fall semester.",AC,NA,NC
526,Grades,AC,NA,NC
465,"I am a bit concerned that, unlike Linear Algebra, there are not quizzes due each week. Those quizzes not only helped to bolster my grade, but they were extremely useful to better understanding content. I will likely need to seek other sources for better understanding this semester.",AC,NA,NC
152,"I am concerned about not learning the content as deeply as I need to. Even after watching lecture videos and reading the textbook and doing the homework, there are still times where I struggle to keep up.",AC,NA,NC
88,I am concerned about taking another calculus class because I have forgotten just about all of the calculus I took previously.,AC,NA,NC
135,I am concerned about the fact that the in person exams count for so much grade-wise which means I don't have very much room for error on the exams.,AC,NA,NC
4,"I am concerned about the lack of quizzes. With linear algebra, I thought that the quizzes helped to reinforce understanding and acted as review material down the line",AC,NA,NC
64,I am most concerned about not understanding the material.,AC,NA,NC
97,"I heard some concepts are difficult to grasp, but otherwise no major concerns!",AC,NA,NC
98,"I tend to struggle with online courses and staying engaged so Im concerned about that. If I'm able to put in the time though, the material should be fairly easy for me.",AC,NA,NC
84,"I wasn't the best at Calc BC, and continuing calculus is a bit nervous for me, but I'm pretty confident with vectors and their related topics so I'm not too worried.",AC,NA,NC
25,"I'm mostly concerned about the difficulty- students generally have mixed opinions about the difficulty of Multivariable calculus as compared to Linear Algebra, so I hope that Multi isn't too much more challenging than LinAlg. ",AC,NA,NC
89,"My concern now is that the exams hold a higher portion in the overall weight grade, but I believe with proper work and attention to learning that shouldn't be a problem. I'm also a bit worried because there are no quizzes each week, so I feel like I can't have that extra review I would normally have to learn. The part that concerns me the most is that we don't have module exams anymore which were helpful to me in the previous semester, but hopefully the kahoots can make up for that.",AC,NA,NC
480,"Not having enough practice without the weekly quizzes, having to learn harder content, greater amount of grade based on exams.",AC,NA,NC
214,"Not having weekly quizzes is a concern to me as they were helpful in gauging our knowledge for the exams last semester. Additionally, the percentage of Exam weight is a slight bit of a concern to me as last semester, I wasn't the best at exam-taking. Nonetheless, I will work this semester to be better.",AC,NA,NC
458,I am worried about having another exam. I did well on exams 1 and 2 during Linear Algebra but they always make me nervous.,AC,NA.,NC
149,"I'm concerned about not being able to attend the live lessons. Last semester I was able to watch recordings for the first quarter, but then I ended up stop watching the lessons altogether and just relied on the lesson videos and textbook.",PC,"NA. I'll ask a lot of questions, I guess.",NC
110,"I am a bit scared about how there are three exams this year instead of two like last year, but I know it will work out as long as I work hard.",AC,NA ,NC
397,"I am also a little worried about the fact that there are fewer assignments, especially with there being no quizzes. This means there will be fewer practices and ""easy"" A's to affect our grades. I am also worried about the fact that there is another exam because exams are not my strong point in this course so this could drop my grade. ",AC,No concerns,NC
364,"I am concerned about my ability to fully understand the subject material. Math does not come easy to me, especially math at this level. So I am also worried about the time I will have to dedicate to succees. ",AC,None,NC
221,"Ensuring that I study ""enough"" before the first exam is my main concern, as I am still learning how much time I need to spend reviewing for collegiate level courses such as this one.",AC,None,NC
43,There are no quizzes every week. I like to use the quizzes for practice and as a checkpoint but now it'll be that much harder to study for the exams. ,AC,Not that I can think of. ,NC
393,I am most concerned about finishing learning and understanding the content before the exams roll around because there seems to be more content than last semester. ,AC,The first B of my high school career was in Math 1554 so I hope that motivates me to push harder for an A this semester. ,PC
552,"I am mostly concerned about being able to fully grasp the content, but that is mostly based on my own personal ability to learn and take the time to study for this course.",AC,"There is not really anything special concerning my needs except that my internet at home can sometimes stop working, but I will do my best to not let this issue affect my work in the course.",TC
